goonfleet-killboard
====

The goonfleet-killboard is a ruby on rails port of the existing goonfleet killboard found at: <http://killboard.goonfleet.com/>.

This port is geared to simplifying and streamlining the entire process of collecting killmails from the Eve-Online in game browser, correlating them into a list and providing a searching mechanism that will allow for different kinds of custom queries.
